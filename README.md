# Next.js 15 Unexpected Error

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Next.js 15 where a seemingly simple application can throw an unexpected error without a clear console message. The issue might stem from middleware or other configurations interfering with the default rendering process.

## Bug Description
A minimal Next.js 15 application, simply displaying 'Hello, world!', unexpectedly throws an error and does not display content.  Debugging this requires carefully inspecting middleware, API routes, and other configuration settings.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the unexpected error or blank screen in the browser.

## Solution
The solution involves analyzing your middleware and other Next.js configurations to identify the root cause of the error.  Often the issue is a missing `try...catch` block in custom middleware functions. The solution below provides an example of how error handling could be implemented in middleware.
